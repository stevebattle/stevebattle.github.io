A Braitenberg vehicle is a robot that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. 
It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point, and one or two wheels.
In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.
