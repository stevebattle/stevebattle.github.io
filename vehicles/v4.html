		<h1>Braitenberg Vehicle #4: <br>Values and Special Tastes</h1>
    <p id="description">
      Vehicle 4 introduces new internal nodes that represent artificial neurons, analogous to our own brain cells. 
      These have a non-linear activation function that controls how much the output is activated by its inputs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vehicle 4a has a neuron with a bell-shaped activation function, or normal distribution.
      When used in neural networks these are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_network"
      >radial basis function networks</a>. 
      The peak of the curve can be shifted to any desired value by adding a fixed bias to the input.
      This bias becomes the preferred value of the neuron, with maximum output at that value.
      Vehicle 4a is created with bias values for each eye that give it a preference for
      a light source to the right of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>A common activation function is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function"
      >sigmoid curve</a>, so-called because of its distinctive 'S' shape.
      Instead of a linear output, the curve switches rapidly from 0 to 1, representing a decision.
      Vehicel 4b makes a decision to turn when it encounters an obstacle, as detected by its proximity sensor.

    <blockquote>"Whatever their origin, 
      thresholds in some behaviour patterns make a lot of difference in the eye of the observer. 
      These creatures, the observer would say, ponder over their decisions."
