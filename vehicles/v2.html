		<h1>Braitenberg Vehicle #2:<br/>Fear and Aggression</h1>
    <p id="description">Braitenberg Vehicles 2a and 2b exhibit negative and positive phototaxis, 
      or directed movement away from, or towards a light source. 
      Light stimulates the sensors on different sides of the robot differentially, 
      causing the motors to run at different rates.

    <blockquote>"Let Vehicles 2a and 2b move around in their world for a while and watch them. 
      Their characters are quite opposite. Both dislike sources. 
      But 2a becomes restless in their vicinity and tends to avoid them, 
      escaping until it safely reaches a place where the influence of the source is scarcely felt. 
      Vehicle 2a is a <b>coward</b>, you would say. Not so Vehicle 2b. 
      It, too, is excited by the presence of sources, 
      but resolutely turns toward them and hits them with high velocity, 
      as if it wanted to destroy them. Vehicle 2b is <b>aggressive</b>, obviously."
