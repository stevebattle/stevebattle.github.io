		<h1>Braitenberg Vehicle #3:<br/>Love</h1>
    <p id="description">Vehicle 2 can only get excited by input, but for Vehicle 3 light inhibits the motors, 
      causing it to slow down and bask in the sunshine that it loves. 
      The more light that falls on the sensor, the greater the inhibitory effect on the motors; 
      the light causes them to slow down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Vehicle 2b, Vehicle 3b utilises crossed connections. 
      Light falling on one side makes the motor on the opposite side slow down, 
      causing the vehicle to shy away from the light that calms it.
    </p>
    <p>Vehicle 3c has not just one pair of light sensors, 
      but an additional distance or proximity sensor which allows the robot to sense oncoming obstructions in 
      its environment. 
      This version of vehicle 3c is inspired by the description in 'Understanding Intelligence' (p187) 
      by Pfeiffer and Scheier, which introduces the proximity sensor and has sensors for different 
      qualities having either positive or negative motor connections. 
      We begin to appreciate the enormous variety of connections, crossed and uncrossed, 
      excitatory and inhibitory, that are possible with this simple multisensorial robot.

    <blockquote>"These vehicles like the source , you will say, but in different ways. 
      Vehicle 3a loves it in a permanent way, 
      staying close by in quiet admiration from the time it spots the source to all future time. 
      Vehicle 3b, on the other hand, is an explorer."<br/>
      "If you consider the possibility of strong and weak influences from the sensors to the motors, 
      you realize that the variety becomes even greater. 
      The vehicle may not care much about light but care very much about temperature."
