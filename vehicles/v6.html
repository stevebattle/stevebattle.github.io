		<h1>Braitenberg Vehicle #6: Selection, the Impersonal Engineer</h1>
    <p id="description">We apply Darwinian selection to vehicles.
      New vehicles are created by random mutation, and
      only those that remain in the window are fit to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model used here is based on W. Ross Ashby's Homeostat described in 
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/designforbrainor00ashb">'Design for a Brain'</a>.
      In chapter 9/16 Ashby describes a mobile Homeostat, U, "suppose U is mobile and is 
      ultrastable, with its critical states set so that it seeks situations of high illumination." 
      The illustration on the vehicle is a representation of the Homeostat, R, engaged with its environment,
      maintaining an <em>essential</em> variable, S, it's proximity to the light.
    </p>
    <blockquote>"Where there has been no conscious engineering at all, as in the case of our type 6 vehicles,
      analysis will necessarily produce the feeling of a <em>mysterious</em> supernatural hand guiding the creation."
    </blockquote>
