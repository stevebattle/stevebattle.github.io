		<h1>Braitenberg Vehicle #5: Logic</h1>
    <p id="description">
      Vehicle 4 introduces new internal nodes that represent artificial neurons, analogous to our own brain cells. 
      These have a non-linear activation function that controls how much the output is activated by its inputs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vehicle 5a has a feed-forward neural network, 
      where the output of one neuron can be the input to another neuron. 
      The main restriction is that these connections must not form a cycle, 
      so it can only <em>react</em> to it's input.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vehicle 5b introduces recurrent excitatory connections in a Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network.
      A pair of mutually inhibitory neurons oscillate to form a Matsuoka oscillator,
      which is used here to control the scanning of the proximity sensor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vehicle 5c looks at recurrent <em>excitatory</em> connections.
      An excitatory autapse appears where a neuron loops back on itself. 
      This creates a positive feedback loop which acts as a neural monostable, 
      which is used here to prolong the momentary stimulus of contact with the vehicle shell long 
      enough for it to reverse clear of the obstacle.

    <blockquote>"This is an elementary sort of MEMORY. 
      It is not difficult to understand how out of such elementary memory stores 
      (consisting of such reciprocally connected threshold devices) complex memories can be synthesised, 
      with the possibility of storing extremely complex events."
